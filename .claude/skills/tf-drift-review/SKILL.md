# Terraform Drift Review Skill
 
When `/tf-drift-review` is invoked:
 
1. Read `CLAUDE.md` before doing anything else.
 
2. Run:
 
   `bash "AI Assignment/tf-drift-check.sh" || true`
 
   from the project root.
 
3. Read:
 
   `reports/tf-drift-report.txt`
 
4. If:
 
   `reports/tfplan.json`
 
   exists, inspect it for additional evidence about flagged resource changes.
 
5. Report:
 
   - Overall status: HEALTHY, WARN, or FAIL
   - Terraform plan detailed exit code and its meaning
   - Every WARN or FAIL result
   - Any resource deletion or replacement
   - Any ingress/security change that exposes `0.0.0.0/0` or `*`
   - A plain-language risk assessment
   - Whether `terraform apply` appears safe based on the evidence
   - One recommended next step for the human operator
 
6. If Terraform reports no changes, state clearly that no infrastructure action is required.
 
7. Do not edit any `.tf` file.
 
8. Never run:
   - `terraform apply`
   - `terraform destroy`
   - Any command using `-auto-approve`
 
9. Do not generate a separate Terraform plan outside `tf-drift-check.sh`. The generated report and JSON are the evidence source for this review.
 
10. The human operator must review and execute any approved infrastructure-changing command manually.
